We are addressing a mechanical problem on a work train in the tunnel connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn.

Expect delays on southbound [Q] trains while they share the track with rerouted trains.

Boarding Change

At Canal St, board [N][Q] trains on the [R][W] platform.

Travel Alternatives

As an alternative for service from Manhattan to Brooklyn, consider using [A][D][F][2][4] trains.</div></div>
