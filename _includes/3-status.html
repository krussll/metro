We are making repairs to a train that derailed near 96 St so that we can move it to its storage facility. After that is done, we plan to inspect the tracks in the area and make any needed repairs to the tracks and infrastructure.

Service Changes
[3] trains are running between 135 St and Harlem-148 St.
Extra [3] train service is running between Times Sq-42 St and Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr.
Southbound [3] trains are running local from Times Sq-42 St to Chambers St, replacing [1] train service.

Travel Alternatives:
For service between Harlem-148 St and 116 St, take M7 buses, which also connect to [A] trains at Cathedral Pkwy (110 St) and free M104 buses at 103 St.

Also, limited southbound [2] service is available south of 135 St (making local stops in Manhattan).</div></div>
