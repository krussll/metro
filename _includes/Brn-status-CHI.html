<p>As a result, <strong>trains are operating only between Belmont and the Loop at this time.</strong></p>

<p>Shuttle buses are available between Kimball and Belmont&nbsp;to provide connecting service.</p>

<p>At this time, also consider other service alternatives that may serve your trip, such as nearby bus routes, or using buses to other rail lines.</p>

<p>See station personnel for further assistance, and pay attention to announcements on trains and at stations for service information.</p>

<p>We are working to restore service as quickly as possible. Allow extra travel time.</p></div></div>
