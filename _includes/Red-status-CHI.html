<p>We apologize for the inconvenience and are working to restore service as quickly as possible. Allow extra travel time.</p>

<h4><b>Red Line&nbsp;service to 95th/Dan Ryan </b></h4>

<p>After stopping at Fullerton,&nbsp;95th-bound trains will be diverted and will make the following elevated station stops:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Armitage (accessible)</li>
	<li>Sedgwick (accessible)</li>
	<li>Chicago (at Franklin; accessible)</li>
	<li>Merchandise Mart (accessible)</li>

	<li>Washington/Wabash&nbsp;(accessible)</li>
	<li>Adams/Wabash</li>
	<li>Roosevelt (elevated station west of Wabash; accessible)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, trains will stop at&nbsp;Cermak-Chinatown and make all normal stops to 95th/Dan Ryan.</p>

<h4><b>Red Line&nbsp;service to Howard</b></h4>

<p>For service toward Howard, after stopping at Cermak-Chinatown, trains will then be diverted to the above-listed elevated stations, in the opposite order, through Armitage and then make all normal stops from Fullerton to Howard.</p>

<h4>For service in areas away from where the Red Line is running</h4>

<p>Consider using local bus alternatives through the area where you&#39;re traveling, including those to other train lines or where Red Line service has been rerouted to operate.</p>
